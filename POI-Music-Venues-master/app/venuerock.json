      "description" : "It’s hard to pinpoint Whelan’s in one particular genre, but one thing is certain, this place rocks until late. Acknowledged internationally as a world class music venue, since its opening in 1989 it has hosted an eclectic mix of up and coming musicians and established artists. From silent disco evenings to indie rock club and guest DJ’s, there’s plenty to choose from. For the rock heads, Saturday’s Indie Rock Club is the best time to go, with live gigs by the coolest bands well after midnight in the venue’s second floor."

Whether you’re more Metallica or The Beatles, there’s a gig for you. Did we mention the bar is shaped like a pirate ship and it features a rum bar and a cool selection of rum cocktails? Yes please."

The Saloon Bar takes the ground floor, with frequent guest DJs and a mix of pop, rock and more dance-able tunes playing (that is, when there’s no big sports game taking over guest’s attention). Go deeper and discover The Flanders Bar, an underground bar where Iron Maiden and the like take over the -very loud- speakers. Finally, there’s The Zodiac Bar, a chiller lounge with more alternative yet equally rocking vibes."

With tourist-stopping street art on its walls featuring the likes of Axl Rose, Mick Jagger, Bono and Steven Tyler it’s no wonder the place is a favourite of local and visiting rockers looking for a good pint and an even better jukebox."
